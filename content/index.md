# Welcome to My Website

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
I'm passionate about technology, creativity, and continuous learning.  
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and ideas â€” ranging from code and design  
to thoughts on innovation, problem-solving, and everything in between.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a curious visitor, or a potential collaborator, feel free to explore,  
connect, and reach out.
